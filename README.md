# RUST API SERVER

## Introduction

Welcome to the Rust API Server! This server provides a simple REST interface for your applications. This README will
guide you through setting up and running the server, as well as configuring its various options.

## How To Run

To get started, execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
./cli --help
```

This will display the available options for running the server:

```
Simple REST server

Usage: cli [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  config  Print config
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --config-path <CONFIG_PATH>  Config file [default: config/default.toml]
  -v, --version                    Print version
  -h, --help                       Print help
```

### Example

- Multiple config locations

```shell
./cli -c ./config/* -c deploy/local/custom.toml
```

- Pipe the output with [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)

```shell
cargo install bunyan
./cli -c ./config/* -c deploy/local/custom.toml | bunyan
```

## Configuration

### Order of apply

Configuration is applied in the following order: config files -> environment variables -> command-line arguments.

### Environment Variable Examples

The server can be configured using environment variables. Below is a table outlining the available configuration
options:

Hierarchical child config via env, separated by using `__`. Specify list values by using `,` separator

| ENV                                                                    | DEFAULT VALUE | NOTE      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| [RUST_LOG](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/) > LOG__LEVEL | "INFO"        | Log level |
| SERVER__URL                                                            |               |           |
| SERVER__PORT                                                           |               |           |
| SERVICE_NAME                                                           |               |           |
| EXPORTER_ENDPOINT                                                      |               |           |
| DB__PG__URL                                                            |               |           |
| DB__PG__MAX_SIZE                                                       |               |           |

Make sure to set these environment variables according to your needs before running the server.
